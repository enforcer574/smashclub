Setting up a local development server

1. Install XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2. Install MySQL Workbench https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
3. Install GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
4. Sign in to GitHub on the desktop client and clone the 'smashclub' repository to your local workspace.
5. Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services
6. Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection:
	Server: localhost or 127.0.0.1
	Port: 3306
	Username: root
	Password: leave blank
7. Create a database for your development server by executing the query below in a new tab, replacing <name> with your name
	CREATE SCHEMA UTCSC_DEV_<name>
8. Import the template file to setup the database
	- In the left sidebar, click 'Data Import/Restore'
	- Under Import options, choose 'Import from Self-Contained File'
	- Browse to and select the UTCSC_DEV.template.sql file from the Git repository
	- Under Default Target Schema, choose the database you created
	- Click 'Start Import' and the schema will be set up with the necessary tables and sample data
9. From the Git repository, copy the contents of the 'htdocs' folder to C:/xampp/htdocs
10. Configure the source files to read your development database
	- Open the file C:/xampp/htdocs/service/app_properties.php
	- Locate the section containing the database credentials
	- $db_server="localhost:3306"; $db_database="UTCSC_DEV_<name>"; $db_username="root"; $db_password="";
11. Open a web browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1 or localhost
	- If your setup is correct, the homepage will appear populated with sample data
	- If there is a problem with the database connection, you will be redirected to a "service unavailable" page
	- If there is a problem with your XAMPP web server, the page may fail to load entirely
