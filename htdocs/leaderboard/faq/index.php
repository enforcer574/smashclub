			<h1>About Ratings</h1>

			<h2>Smash Skill Rating</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			Your <b>Smash Skill Rating (SSR)</b> is an objective rating of your overall skill level in the different Super Smash Bros games throughout history. You have a different SSR for each game - Smash 64, Melee, Brawl, and Wii U / 3DS. SSR ranges from 1 to 3000 and falls into one of twelve <b>skill tiers.</b> Your skill tier is displayed on your public profile.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<b>How does it work?</b> Any time you win a match in ranked (competitive) play, your SSR will increase. Every time you lose a match, your SSR will decrease. The amount of points you gain or lose on a win or loss depends on the SSR of the opponent you faced. You gain more points if you beat an opponent with a higher rating than you, and you lose more points if you are defeated by an opponent with a lower rating than you.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<b>What is a "Good" rating?</b> The loose average SSR is around 1200, based on how the system places new players. But being below that doesn't mean you're a bad player! Remember, this is not a competition about who's got the highest rank. It's a tool to help you get high-quality opponents that are in a similar skill level to you.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<b>How can I increase my rating?</b> Win more matches! As you win ranked matches, your SSR will climb and the matchmaking system (Find An Opponent) will place you against higher-ranked opponents. As long as you win more than you lose, your SSR will keep going up. Once you reach the point where you're winning and losing about the same amount and getting fair fights, your rating will stay mostly the same. This is the best rating for you to have, to get the fairest opponents.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<b>Are ratings a competition?</b> Not really. The main point of your SSR is to place you against opponents with a similar skill level so you have fair and enjoyable fights. No one likes getting slaughtered by more experienced players! However, <b>Your individual rating is MUCH more important than how you stack up against others.</b> If you played in two different clubs, you'd likely have a similar SSR in both. That rating might be 3rd place in one club and 20th in another - but that doesn't matter! What's important is that you get fair opponents and can see yourself improving.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<b>Can I reset my rating?</b> Every time a new season begins, you will have to complete a number of <b>Placement Matches</b> before you get your initial rating for the season. The placement system will use your previous seasons' ratings as a starting point, so it's not a completely clean slate. But if you win most of your placement matches, you will get a higher rating than last season.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">
			<b>Why do some people have a skill tier that's higher than their rating?</b> Once you reach a certain skill tier, you will keep that tier's badge for the rest of the season. The only tiers you can "drop out of" are the Master tiers.
